# Problem

Table: `sales`

```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| sale_id       | int     |
| product_id    | int     |
| sale_date     | date    |
| quantity      | int     |
| price         | decimal |
+---------------+---------+
sale_id is the unique identifier for this table.
Each row contains information about a product sale including the product_id, date of sale, quantity sold, and price per unit.
```

Table: `products`

```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| product_name  | varchar |
| category      | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
product_id is the unique identifier for this table.
Each row contains information about a product including its name and category.
```

Write a solution to find the most popular product category for each season. The seasons are defined as:
  * Winter: December, January, February
  * Spring: March, April, May
  * Summer: June, July, August
  * Fall: September, October, November

The popularity of a category is determined by the total quantity sold in that season. If there is a tie, select the category with the highest total revenue (quantity Ã— price).

Return the result table ordered by season in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example:

```
Input:

sales table:

+---------+------------+------------+----------+-------+
| sale_id | product_id | sale_date  | quantity | price |
+---------+------------+------------+----------+-------+

+---------+------------+------------+----------+-------+
products table:

+------------+-----------------+----------+
